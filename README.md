# Data Science - Coursera

Github repository for some of the courses in the [Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) specialization, which is a set of ten courses on Coursera delivered by Johns Hopkins University (JHU), the courses were the following:

1. The Data Scientist's Toolbox
2. R Programming
3. Getting and Cleaning Data
4. Exploratory Data Analysis
5. Reproducible Research
6. Statistical Inference
7. Regression Models
8. Practical Machine Learning
9. Developing Data Products
10. Data Science Capstone

It is worth noting that some of the courses did not require a github repo for evaluation, as a consequence, only the contributions that required a github repo for evaluation are included as folders.
